    Sum tree data structure where data is stored in leaves and each node on the
    tree contains a sum of the children.

    Items and priorities are stored in leaf nodes, while internal nodes store
    the sum of priorities from all its descendants. Internally a single list
    stores the internal nodes followed by leaf nodes.
