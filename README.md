# Digital Building Model Navigation

Robotic navigation in a real-time digital building model. Agents learn how to navigate in a simulated environment, avoiding walls and other agents.

# Setup
The digital building model has realistic physics, implimented using PyBullet. A great tutorial for
PyBullet can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit.
The conda package manager is used to manage dependencies. To install the required packages:

```sh
cd sim
conda env create -f sim.yml
```

# Training
There are two types of agenta which can be trained to navigate the enviroment:
* Seeker - An agent that uses a Lidar sensor to avoid walls
* Mapper - An agent that uses a stack of 2D maps to navigate in the world

In general, `Seeker` is easier to train but `Mapper` performs better. 

Training requires a large number of samples and should be conducted on a Ray cluster.
```sh
ray attach --tmux cluster.yaml
python train.py configs/mapper-apex-td3.yaml
```

### Training locally
Is is possible to run the training process locally:
```sh
python train.py configs/mapper-test.yaml --dev=True
```

# Environment
The environment can be tested using a very simple policy (no RL) using the `benchmark.py` file.
```
python benchmark.py             # Render environment
python benchmark.py --no-render # Benchmark environment performance
```

# Evaluation
A trained agent can be evaluated using the `rollout.py` file.
```
python rollout.py --run APEX_DDPG --env MultiRobot-v0 --steps 1000
python rollout.py --run APEX_DDPG --env MultiRobot-v0 --steps 10000 --checkpoint=/path/to/checkpoint
python rollout.py --run APEX_DDPG --env MultiRobot-v0 --steps 10000 --no-render
```

# Prerequsites:
Some parts of the codebase rely on the latest (`0.7.0`) release of ray. Installing ray with `pip install ray` should work. However, it is better to install the dev version: 

```sh
# Linux
pip install -U https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-0.7.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl

# Mac OSX
pip install -U https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-0.7.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_6_intel.whl
```

If you have problems with ROS, remove any references to python2.7 from PATH and PYTHONPATH

# Clusters
```sh
# Create or update the cluster
$ ray up configs/cluster.yaml

# Reconfigure autoscaling behavior without interrupting running jobs
$ ray up configs/cluster.yaml --max-workers=N --no-restart

# Teardown the cluster
$ ray down configs/cluster.yaml
```
